#This file is going to be a basis of what I know of programming
#This will have a lot of random text parts, as this is just a preview for anyone who wants to know the level of proficiency in coding

#Variables
#Here I will code using variables

x_first= ("Hello, my name is Mark")
print (x_first)

#printing specific values located in the variables
print (x_first[:8])
>>>"Hello, m"
# " " "
print (x_first[2:10])
